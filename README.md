Expense_Prediction
We are predicting whether a salaried class employee's expense is greater than $50,000 or less than $50,000. I have used various ML models and ensemble techniques to make these predictions.

We don't have training and test data. so we have divided the data into train and test and calculated the accuracy score and classification report on this basis.
